<!-- TODO display the header component then the router outlet which is goint to display the pages (HomePage, ContactPage, Services), by default for clients is going to show the
homePage, for workers/managers is going to display the dataPage/harvest/fields page.

idea:

<header-component> // this will display on every page

<router-outlet> // this will show the page (routing needed within the buttons of the header component)

-->
